We implemented together the Convex Hull algorithm and the k-d Tree algorithm.

- In order to show the animations for these algorithms, you have to set the value of ALGO_SELECTION to 1 if you want to show the k-d Tree animations or to 2 if you want to show the Convex Hull animations.
- For the Convex Hull algorithm, STEP_CONVEX_HULL has to be set to 1 to show every step of the algorithm. To show only the end result this value can be set to 0.
- For the k-d Tree, ANIM_KD_TREE can be set to 1 to show every subdivision of the space or set to 2 to show only show one side of the subdivision to have a clearer look at the result.
- SHOW_ANIM can be set to 0 to disable the animations, default is 1 to activate them.
